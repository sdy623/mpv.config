## Installation

- First, install a player: **Windows:** [Official builds - Recommended](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/releases), [Daily builds - Recommended](https://github.com/zhongfly/mpv-winbuild/releases), [shinchiro builds](https://github.com/shinchiro/mpv-winbuild-cmake/releases), or [mpv.net builds](https://github.com/mpvnet-player/mpv.net/releases). **macOS, Linux:** [Download mpv from the official website](https://mpv.io/installation/)
- [🎯 Click here to download](https://github.com/akFace/mpv.config/releases) the theme you want (`modernz` or `uosc`). Each archive already contains a complete functional configuration. Extract it after downloading.
- **The following example uses Windows: ① and ② correspond to the player you choose; follow the relevant instructions.**
- **①. Official mpv player**: After extracting/installing the player, create a folder named `portable_config` in the player root directory (the same directory as `mpv.exe`) and use it as the `configuration folder`.
- **②. mpv.net player**: right-click > Configuration > Open Configuration Folder, or press `Ctrl + f` to open the `configuration folder`.

- **Copy all extracted files into the `configuration folder` (only one theme configuration can be used at a time)**

- **Language:** The language setting for the ModernZ theme is located in `script-opts/modernz.conf`, while the language setting for the UOSC theme is located in `script-opts/uosc.conf`. To change the language, search for the keyword `language` in the corresponding file. Download [`input-en.conf`](https://github.com/akFace/mpv.config/blob/master/src/input-en.conf), rename it to `input.conf`, and replace the original `input.conf` file with it, then restart the player.

- **Note the directory structure**

```
A typical directory structure looks like this:
~/mpv/configuration folder
      ├── fonts
      ├── scripts
      ├── script-opts
      ├── mpv.conf
      └── input.conf
```

For standard mpv installations using `setup-install` (not the `Portable` version), the global configuration directories are:

```
Linux:   ~/.config/mpv/
Windows: C:/Users/%username%/AppData/Roaming/mpv/
macOS:   ~/Library/Application Support/mpv/
```

> ⚠️ **Tip**: If you are using the mpv.net player and thumbnails occasionally fail to load, change `mpv_path=mpv` in `script-opts/thumbfast.conf` to `mpv_path=mpvnet`, or specify the executable in the player installation directory, for example: `mpv_path=C:\Program Files\mpv.net\mpvnet.exe`
>
> - On other platforms, the [uosc_danmaku](https://github.com/Tony15246/uosc_danmaku/issues/194) plugin may sometimes prevent the player from opening. See the [context menu troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/akFace/mpv-menu-plugin-next/blob/main/doc/README.md#linux) and check for a solution.
